# Current Context

Last updated: 2026-05-29, Asia/Shanghai.

## Current Git State

The whitelist/reminder-doc change has been committed:

- Commit `bed3ed9 移除德丙白名单并新增接力文档`
- Included `config/leagues.yaml`, `tests/test_settings.py`, `Agent.md`, `memory.md`, and `Context.md`

The DB was also updated locally:

- `leagues.source_league_id='80'` is now `is_enabled=0`.

Focused test run before commit:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='src'; $env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_settings.py -q
```

Result: `3 passed`.

## Current Odds Coverage Snapshot

Using finished matches after `2026-01-15` as denominator, before removing 德丙:

- Eligible matches: `5943`
- Successful odds matches: `4970`
- Coverage: `83.6%`
- Full three-market matches: `4970`
- empty: `444`
- none: `428`
- unmatched: `0` after cleanup
- unavailable: increased by 4 after cleanup
- failed: `0`

After disabling 德丙 locally, enabled eligible total is `5753`.

Leagues still completely unrunned or intentionally pending:

- 欧冠
- 欧联
- 欧协联

德丙 should no longer be treated as a target whitelist league.

## Last Completed Work

1. Ran full local odds audit for 2025/2026.
2. Committed backfill tooling and alias improvements in `89efda1`.
3. Rechecked the four remaining unmatched matches:
   - `4652` 西乙 Sporting Gijon vs Leganes
   - `5501` 法乙 Bastia vs Le Mans
   - `6502` 荷乙 Cambuur vs Vitesse
   - `15939` 瑞典超甲 GIF Sundsvall vs United Nordic
4. All four still failed fixture matching after targeted retry, so they were marked `unavailable`.
5. Removed 德丙 from `config/leagues.yaml` and adjusted `tests/test_settings.py`.
6. Committed the 德丙 whitelist removal and relay docs in `bed3ed9`.
7. Ran a read-only precheck for five new main leagues using official API-Football metadata, API-Football fixtures, and OddsPapi `tournaments`/`fixtures`. This did not write to DB and did not fetch historical odds.
8. Synced API-Football fixture/results history for the five new main leagues only. This pulled schedule/result data, not odds:
   - 爱超 `357`, season `2026`: `created=180`
   - 芬甲二级 `1087` Ykkösliiga, season `2026`: `created=135`
   - 挪甲 `104`, season `2026`: `created=240`
   - 丹麦甲 `120`, season `2025`: `created=192`
   - 印尼超 `274`, season `2025`: `created=306`
9. These five leagues were initially kept disabled while they were being validated, but they are now treated as regular main leagues.
10. Added OddsPapi tournament mappings for the five new main leagues in `9f51cd0`:
   - `357 -> 192` 爱超
   - `1087 -> 55` 芬甲/Ykkösliiga
   - `104 -> 22` 挪甲
   - `120 -> 47` 丹麦甲
   - `274 -> 1015` 印尼超
11. Ran a small OddsPapi historical-odds sample backfill, 3 matches per new main league. Final result after alias retry:
   - 挪甲: `3/3` success
   - 芬甲: `2/3` success, `1` unavailable 404 (`17572` SJK Akatemia vs Haka)
   - 丹麦甲: `1/3` success, `1` unavailable 404 (`18040` Kolding IF vs B 93), `1` unmatched (`18041` Hillerød vs Aarhus Fremad)
   - 印尼超: `3/3` success
   - 爱超: `2/3` success, `1` unavailable 404 (`17471` Bohemians vs Shamrock Rovers)
12. Added alias fixes that turned 3 unmatched samples into successful backfills:
   - `hodd -> Hoedd IL`
   - `Strommen -> Stroemmen IF`
   - `EIF -> Ekenas Idrottsforening`
13. Ran the first larger 2026 worker for 挪甲/芬甲/爱超. Worker completed:
   - Total: processed `142`, snapshots `20072`, failed `35`, requests `292`.
   - 挪甲: finished `71`, success/snapshot matches `46` before post-fix, then `47` after targeted alias retry; remaining `unknown=13`, `unavailable=10`.
   - 芬甲: finished `40`, success `18` before post-fix, then `20` after targeted alias retry; remaining `unknown=11`, `unavailable=9`.
   - 爱超: finished `91`, success `84`, unavailable `6`, empty `1`. This league looks healthy enough for future continuation.
14. Post-worker alias repair added:
   - `ODD Ballklubb -> Odds BK`
   - `Stromsgodset -> Stroemsgodset IF`
   - `Kooteepee -> FC KTP Kotka`
   - `MP -> Mikkelin Palloilijat`
   Targeted retry of `17737,17733,17575,17571` produced 3 successes and 1 real 404 (`17737` ODD Ballklubb vs Ranheim).

## Likely Next Work

2026-05-29 later update:

- The five new leagues are now regular main leagues, not candidate leagues.
- Odds backfill for these five main leagues is effectively complete for the current finished-match window.
- Current new main league status:
  - Ireland Premier Division `357`: success `84`, unavailable `6`, empty `1`.
  - Finland Ykkosliiga `1087`: success `29`, unavailable `11`.
  - Norway 1. Division `104`: success `61`, unavailable `10`.
  - Denmark 1. Division `120`: success `69`, unavailable `9`.
  - Indonesia Liga 1 `274`: success `117`, empty `11`, unavailable `25`.
- Remaining failures are no longer alias backlog. They are OddsPapi 404/unavailable, empty usable main-line snapshots, or fixture candidates that clearly do not match the API-Football target match.
- Added Denmark 1. Division OddsPapi team aliases:
  - `Hillerød -> Hillerod Fodbold`
  - `B 93 -> B93 Copenhagen`
  - `HB Koge -> HB Koege`
- The user completed another pass of Chinese team display names in `config/display_names.yaml`.
- UEFA competitions: refreshed API-Football results only for 2025 season; no OddsPapi odds backfill.
  - UEFA Champions League `2`: total `281`, finished `280`, one future/not-finished final on `2026-05-31`.
  - UEFA Europa League `3`: total/finished `271`.
  - UEFA Europa Conference League `848`: total/finished `409`.
- Current direction: do not backfill UEFA odds yet. Keep UEFA results as auxiliary future context, not as the main training sample.

Recommended next step:

1. Freeze and commit display names plus Denmark alias repair.
2. Keep the five new leagues enabled in config and DB as regular main leagues.
3. Build a training dataset/audit report that separates main enabled leagues and UEFA auxiliary results.
4. Run a first model-training baseline using only settled matches with complete three-market OddsPapi snapshots.

The following five leagues have been added to the regular main-league set:

- 爱超, Ireland
- 芬甲, Finland second tier
- 挪甲, Norway second tier
- 丹麦甲, Denmark second tier
- 印尼超, Indonesia top tier

芬甲二级人工校对样本, all `Group Stage`, not playoff/promotion/relegation-looking:

- `17537` API `1504193`, `2026-04-04 00:00` BJT, PK-35 4-2 EIF
- `17538` API `1504194`, `2026-04-06 21:00` BJT, JIPPO 0-0 JäPS

- `17545` API `1504201`, `2026-04-11 23:00` BJT, PK-35 0-0 Haka

Observed alias needs before any real backfill:

- 印尼超: `Pusamania Borneo -> Borneo Samarinda`, `Persepam Madura Utd -> Madura United`, `PSBS Biak Numfor -> PSBS Biak`.
- 丹麦甲: `HB Koge -> HB Koege`, `B 93` may need manual alias/normalization check.
- 挪甲: `hodd`, `Strommen`, `Stromsgodset`, and `ODD Ballklubb` are now fixed in config. `Sogndal`/`Sandnes ULF` may still need alias review.
- 芬甲: `EIF`, `Kooteepee`, and `MP` are now fixed in config. `SJK Akatemia` and possible future `KäPa` variants may still need alias review.

Current modeling direction:

1. Treat 爱超, 芬甲, 挪甲, 丹麦甲, and 印尼超 exactly like the other enabled main leagues.
2. Do not backfill UEFA odds yet; keep UEFA results as auxiliary future context.
3. Next major task is a full main-league training data audit using enabled leagues only.

Main-league training data audit completed:

- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-main-league-training-data-audit.md`
- Scope: enabled main leagues, UEFA excluded from odds sample, `kickoff_time >= 2026-01-15`.
- Eligible main-league matches: `5981`.
- Complete three-market OddsPapi/Pinnacle matches: `5330` (`89.1%`).
- Status split: success `5330`, empty `456`, unavailable `95`, none `100`, unmatched `0`, failed `0`.
- New five main leagues contribute `360` complete three-market matches from `433` eligible matches (`83.1%`).
- Low coverage under 80%: Ykkosliiga `72.5%`, Liga 1 Indonesia `76.5%`, Eerste Divisie `76.8%`.
- Recommended next step: build the baseline training dataset from complete three-market main-league matches.

Baseline training dataset v1 completed:

- Generator command: `icewine samples baseline-dataset`.
- Local CSV output: `local_data/training/baseline_main_leagues_20260529.csv` (gitignored local data).
- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-baseline-training-dataset.md`.
- Scope matches the main-league audit: enabled main leagues, UEFA excluded, finished/scored, `kickoff_time >= 2026-01-15` using the DB wall-time boundary.
- Rows: `5330` complete three-market matches from `5981` eligible main-league matches; coverage `0.8912`.
- CSV has `42` columns and includes match metadata, scores, result labels, close-line odds/probabilities/overrounds for `asian_handicap`, `total_goals`, and `match_winner`.
- Boundary note: a Saudi match at DB kickoff `2026-01-14 22:45:00` is intentionally excluded to stay aligned with the audit's literal DB timestamp window.

Baseline training dataset QA completed:

- QA command: `icewine samples baseline-dataset-qa`.
- QA report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-baseline-training-dataset-qa.md`.
- Rows/columns: `5330` rows, `42` columns.
- Validation issues: empty required cells `0`, invalid odds cells `0`, invalid probability cells `0`, invalid overround cells `0`.
- Thin-history rows: `152` (`0.0285`).
- Overround ranges: asian handicap `1.0090-1.0786`, total goals `1.0140-1.0922`, match winner `1.0171-1.1057`.
- Match results: home win `2325`, draw `1404`, away win `1601`.
- Low sample leagues under 30 rows: Ykkosliiga `29`.
- Recommended next step: close-market baseline evaluation on this CSV.

Close-market baseline evaluation completed:

- Command: `icewine samples baseline-market-baseline`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-close-market-baseline-evaluation.md`.
- Evaluated market samples: `15326` of `15990`; skipped `664` mostly due binary-market push settlement.
- Asian handicap: evaluated `4928`, skipped `402`, accuracy `0.5244`, log loss `0.6921`, brier `0.4412`, avg overround `1.0273`, max-probability flat ROI `-0.0188`.
- Total goals: evaluated `5068`, skipped `262`, accuracy `0.5199`, log loss `0.6924`, brier `0.4474`, avg overround `1.0320`, max-probability flat ROI `-0.0220`.
- Match winner: evaluated `5330`, skipped `0`, accuracy `0.5032`, log loss `1.0055`, brier `0.6015`, avg overround `1.0390`, max-probability flat ROI `-0.0357`.
- This looks like a sane market baseline: all simple max-probability flat-bet ROIs are negative and broadly track market overround.
- Recommended next step: build first model feature set and compare validation metrics against this close-market baseline.

Web training workspace v1 completed:

- The Web console "模型训练" page is now a real training workflow workspace instead of only a static model overview.
- Backend endpoints added:
  - `GET /api/training/workspace`
  - `POST /api/training/baseline-dataset`
  - `POST /api/training/baseline-dataset-qa`
  - `POST /api/training/market-baseline`
- The backend still delegates business logic to the existing Python services/CLI layer and returns refreshed workspace status after each action.
- Frontend now shows baseline dataset status, QA status, close-market baseline metrics, report paths, and workflow buttons for generating the dataset, running QA, and running the market baseline.
- The model training page still keeps existing model-run and league-coverage panels below the new workflow panels.
- Verification run for this work:
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_web_console_api.py -q` -> `14 passed`
  - `npm test -- modelTrainingWorkspace.test.ts` from `web` -> `5 passed`
  - `npm run build` from `web` -> passed
- `npm install` was run in `web` to restore local frontend dev dependencies; npm reported 5 moderate vulnerabilities, but no package manifest/lockfile diff was produced.

Baseline feature set v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-feature-set`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_feature_set_service.py`.
- Local feature CSV output: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv` (local data, not committed).
- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-baseline-feature-set-v1.md`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Rows: `5330`; train rows `4262`; validation rows `1068`.
- Split: time-ordered, validation ratio target `0.2000`, with identical kickoff times kept in the same split.
- Train window: `2026-01-17T14:00:00` to `2026-05-03T07:15:00`.
- Validation window: `2026-05-03T07:30:00` to `2026-05-28T00:00:00`.
- Zero-history rows: `421`.
- Feature rows use only prior same-league team history before each kickoff: rolling matches, points/match, W/D/L rates, goals for/against, venue-specific prior points, rest days, close lines, and close implied probabilities/overrounds.
- Focused verification:
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_baseline_feature_set_service.py -q` -> `4 passed`
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_samples_cli.py -q` -> `21 passed`

Baseline match-winner model v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-match-winner-model`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_match_winner_model_service.py`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-match-winner-model-v1.md`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Model type: scikit-learn `LogisticRegression` with median imputation, standard scaling, balanced class weights, `max_iter=1000`, `random_state=42`.
- Three model variants:
  - `team_form_only`: 20 rolling same-league team-history features.
  - `team_form_plus_market`: team-history features plus match-winner close implied probabilities/overround, 24 features.
  - `team_form_plus_all_markets`: team-history features plus match-winner, Asian handicap, and total-goals close line/probability/overround features, 32 features.
- Validation rows: `1068` from the feature-set v1 time split.
- Close-market match-winner reference is now recomputed on the same validation split: evaluated `1068`, accuracy `0.5009`, log loss `1.3146`, brier `0.6071`.
- Validation close-market predicted result distribution: home win `737`, draw `2`, away win `329`.
- Results:
  - `team_form_only`: accuracy `0.3811`, log loss `1.1378`, brier `0.6582`.
  - `team_form_plus_market`: accuracy `0.4579`, log loss `1.3126`, brier `0.6275`.
  - `team_form_plus_all_markets`: accuracy `0.4466`, log loss `1.3155`, brier `0.6285`.
- Initial read: `team_form_plus_market` is roughly tied with same-split close market on log loss, trails it on accuracy/Brier, and predicts many more draws; adding Asian handicap and total-goals market features did not improve the match-winner proxy task. These markets may still be useful for the actual Asian handicap / total-goals targets rather than for胜平负.
- Calibration buckets were added to the match-winner model report:
  - close market: confidence buckets are broadly monotonic; 0.80-0.90 bucket has `13` samples, avg confidence `0.8306`, accuracy `0.9231`.
  - `team_form_only`: `798/1068` validation rows sit in 0.30-0.40 confidence with avg confidence `0.3679`, accuracy `0.3283`; low confidence concentration explains the low accuracy despite better log loss.
  - `team_form_plus_market`: calibration is broadly monotonic and close-market-like; 0.60-0.70 bucket has avg confidence `0.6449`, accuracy `0.6907`.
  - `team_form_plus_all_markets`: calibration remains broadly monotonic, but metrics are slightly worse than `team_form_plus_market`.
- Focused verification:
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_baseline_match_winner_model_service.py -q` -> `2 passed`
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_baseline_match_winner_model_service.py tests/test_samples_cli.py tests/test_baseline_feature_set_service.py -q` -> `29 passed`
  - `C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_samples_cli.py tests/test_baseline_match_winner_model_service.py -q` -> `25 passed`

Baseline Asian handicap model v1 completed:

- Feature set v1 now carries Asian handicap target/result and odds fields:
  - `target_asian_handicap_home_result`
  - `target_asian_handicap_away_result`
  - `asian_handicap_home_odds`
  - `asian_handicap_away_odds`
- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-asian-handicap-model`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_asian_handicap_model_service.py`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-asian-handicap-model-v1.md`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Scope: binary Asian handicap direction only; rows with push/half-win/half-loss or non-clear settlement are skipped for v1.
- Rows: `5330`; train rows `3317`; validation rows `853`; skipped rows `1160`.
- Same-split close-market reference: evaluated `853`, accuracy `0.5287`, log loss `0.6971`, brier `0.4978`.
- Results:
  - `team_form_plus_match_winner_market`: accuracy `0.5064`, log loss `0.6965`, brier `0.4996`.
  - `team_form_plus_all_markets`: accuracy `0.5334`, log loss `0.6993`, brier `0.4990`.
- Initial read: full-market features improve directional accuracy versus close market, but log loss/Brier do not clearly beat market. All confidence is concentrated around 0.50-0.60, which confirms Asian handicap v1 is a thin-edge, near-coinflip task.

Baseline total-goals model v1 completed:

- Feature set v1 now also carries total-goals target/result and odds fields:
  - `target_total_goals_over_result`
  - `target_total_goals_under_result`
  - `total_goals_over_odds`
  - `total_goals_under_odds`
- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-total-goals-model`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_total_goals_model_service.py`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-total-goals-model-v1.md`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Scope: binary total-goals direction only; rows with push/half-win/half-loss or non-clear settlement are skipped for v1.
- Rows: `5330`; train rows `3476`; validation rows `891`; skipped rows `963`.
- Same-split close-market reference: evaluated `891`, accuracy `0.5174`, log loss `0.6927`, brier `0.4996`.
- Results:
  - `team_form_plus_match_winner_market`: accuracy `0.4871`, log loss `0.6970`, brier `0.5039`.
  - `team_form_plus_all_markets`: accuracy `0.4994`, log loss `0.6991`, brier `0.5059`.
- Initial read: total-goals v1 does not beat the same-split close market on accuracy, log loss, or Brier. The model leans under-heavy and confidence remains mostly 0.50-0.60, so the current feature set is not recommendation-ready for totals.

Baseline market diagnostics v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-market-diagnostics`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_market_diagnostics_service.py`.
- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-baseline-market-diagnostics-v1.md`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Scope: validation split only, close-market implied-probability direction, binary clear-settlement rows only.
- Rows: `5330`; validation rows `1068`.
- Asian handicap diagnostics:
  - Eligible rows `853`; skipped rows `215`; close-market accuracy `0.5287`.
  - Actual side distribution is almost balanced: away cover `427`, home cover `426`.
  - Market predicted home cover more often than actual: predicted home cover `468`, away cover `385`.
  - By actual side: home cover accuracy `0.5775`, away cover accuracy `0.4801`.
  - By line, stronger sample-size segments include `-0.50` accuracy `0.5833`, `0.25` accuracy `0.6000`, `-1.00` accuracy `0.5862`; weak segments include `-0.75` accuracy `0.4667`, `-1.50` accuracy `0.3913`, `1.00` accuracy `0.1333` with only `15` rows.
- Total-goals diagnostics:
  - Eligible rows `891`; skipped rows `177`; close-market accuracy `0.5174`.
  - Actual side distribution is also balanced: over `449`, under `442`.
  - Market confidence buckets are all `0.50-0.60` for both Asian handicap and total goals, so close-market confidence does not provide useful segmentation yet.
  - By actual side: over accuracy `0.5345`, under accuracy `0.5000`.
  - By line, larger sample-size segments are mostly close to coinflip: `2.50` accuracy `0.5060`, `2.75` accuracy `0.5188`, `3.00` accuracy `0.5469`, `2.25` accuracy `0.5221`; `3.50` is better at `0.6061` over `66` rows.
- Initial read: diagnostics reinforce that current close-market labels are thin-edge and balanced. The next useful modeling step is likely adding richer pre-match dynamics/features, not simply slicing by market confidence.

Historical odds anchor coverage v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples historical-odds-anchor-coverage`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/historical_odds_anchor_coverage_service.py`.
- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-historical-odds-anchor-coverage-v1.md`.
- Scope: all finished/scored matches after `2026-01-15` Beijing time, no season filter, bookmaker `pinnacle`, core markets `asian_handicap` and `total_goals`.
- Eligible matches: `6377`.
- Both Asian handicap and total goals:
  - Samples: `5330`; sample coverage vs eligible matches `0.8358`.
  - Complete core-anchor samples (`24h`, `12h`, `6h`, `3h`, `1h`, `close`): `5109`; eligible coverage `0.8012`.
  - Average snapshots: Asian handicap `48.84`, total goals `48.81`.
  - Anchor coverage inside the `5330` available samples:
    - `24h`: `5109`, sample coverage `0.9585`.
    - `12h`: `5175`, sample coverage `0.9709`.
    - `6h`: `5330`, sample coverage `1.0000`.
    - `3h`: `5330`, sample coverage `1.0000`.
    - `1h`: `5330`, sample coverage `1.0000`.
    - `close`: `5330`, sample coverage `1.0000`.
- Initial read: dynamic market features are viable. A v1 feature set can safely use `6h`, `3h`, `1h`, and `close`; `24h`/`12h` are also strong enough if missing values are imputed or if a complete-core subset is used for comparison.

Baseline dynamic feature set v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-dynamic-feature-set`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_dynamic_feature_set_service.py`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Output: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv` (local generated data, not committed).
- Report: `docs/数据审计/20260529-baseline-dynamic-feature-set-v1.md`.
- Rows: `5330`.
- Rows with Asian handicap dynamic features: `5330`.
- Rows with total-goals dynamic features: `5330`.
- Complete core-anchor rows (`6h`, `3h`, `1h`, `close` for both Asian handicap and total goals): `5330`.
- Dynamic CSV has `166` unique columns. Close-anchor dynamic fields are named with `close_anchor` (for example `asian_handicap_close_anchor_line`) to avoid colliding with existing static close fields.
- Feature families added for both `asian_handicap` and `total_goals`:
  - Anchor line, odds, implied probabilities, and overround for `24h`, `12h`, `6h`, `3h`, `1h`, and `close_anchor`.
  - Anchor-to-close line movement and side probability movement.
  - Snapshot count and missing anchor labels.
- Initial read: the dynamic feature set is ready for the next modeling pass. Use the generated dynamic CSV as the model input and compare static-only vs static+dynamic variants for Asian handicap and total goals.

Dynamic market model comparison v1 completed:

- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Reports:
  - `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-asian-handicap-dynamic-model-v1.md`.
  - `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-total-goals-dynamic-model-v1.md`.
- Code now automatically adds dynamic model variants when the input CSV contains the dynamic core anchor columns:
  - Market-specific dynamic core: `6h`, `3h`, `1h`, `close_anchor`.
  - All dynamic core: both Asian handicap and total goals dynamic core columns.
- Asian handicap validation:
  - Rows `5330`; train `3317`; validation `853`; skipped `1160`.
  - Close-market reference: accuracy `0.5287`, log loss `0.6971`, brier `0.4978`.
  - Static all-market model: accuracy `0.5334`, log loss `0.6993`, brier `0.4990`.
  - Asian handicap dynamic core: accuracy `0.5346`, log loss `0.6991`, brier `0.5001`.
  - All dynamic core: accuracy `0.5346`, log loss `0.6991`, brier `0.5001`.
- Total goals validation:
  - Rows `5330`; train `3476`; validation `891`; skipped `963`.
  - Close-market reference: accuracy `0.5174`, log loss `0.6927`, brier `0.4996`.
  - Static all-market model: accuracy `0.4994`, log loss `0.6991`, brier `0.5059`.
  - Total-goals dynamic core: accuracy `0.4938`, log loss `0.6991`, brier `0.5059`.
  - All dynamic core: accuracy `0.4938`, log loss `0.6993`, brier `0.5061`.
- Initial read: dynamic core features are not yet a clear win. Asian handicap has only a tiny accuracy lift with no log-loss improvement; total goals gets worse. Next modeling step should probably compare a less linear model or more targeted movement features before integrating this into recommendation logic.

HistGradientBoosting model comparison v1 completed:

- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Reports:
  - `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-asian-handicap-hgb-comparison-v1.md`.
  - `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-total-goals-hgb-comparison-v1.md`.
- Code behavior:
  - Static feature CSV still only runs the existing LogisticRegression variants.
  - Dynamic feature CSV now also runs `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` variants for the same feature groups.
- Asian handicap validation:
  - Close-market reference: accuracy `0.5287`, log loss `0.6971`, brier `0.4978`.
  - Best LogisticRegression accuracy: `0.5346` with dynamic core, log loss `0.6991`.
  - Best HGB accuracy: `0.5487` on `hgb_team_form_plus_all_markets`, log loss `0.7781`, brier `0.5166`.
  - HGB dynamic variants did not beat HGB static all-markets on accuracy.
- Total goals validation:
  - Close-market reference: accuracy `0.5174`, log loss `0.6927`, brier `0.4996`.
  - Best LogisticRegression accuracy: `0.4994` on static all-markets, log loss `0.6991`.
  - Best HGB accuracy: `0.5354` on `hgb_team_form_plus_all_markets`, log loss `0.7416`, brier `0.5399`.
  - HGB dynamic variants improved over LogisticRegression but did not beat HGB static all-markets on accuracy.
- Initial read: tree model learns useful direction signal, especially for total goals, but probabilities are poorly calibrated/too confident. Dynamic core features still are not clearly helpful. Next useful step is a probability calibration or edge-threshold backtest rather than adding this directly to recommendation logic.

Baseline edge-threshold backtest v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-edge-backtest`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_edge_backtest_service.py`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-edge-backtest-v1.md`.
- Scope:
  - Asian handicap and total goals only.
  - Uses `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` with `team_form_plus_all_markets` features, because this was the best HGB accuracy variant in the previous comparison.
  - Compares raw HGB probabilities with sigmoid-calibrated HGB probabilities.
  - For each validation match, selects the side with the largest `model_probability - normalized_market_probability`, then evaluates thresholds `0.00`, `0.02`, `0.04`, `0.06`, `0.08`, `0.10`.
- Asian handicap:
  - Raw HGB all-threshold bets: `853`, accuracy `0.5522`, profit `60.3310`, ROI `0.0707`.
  - Raw HGB remains positive across thresholds through `0.10`, but log loss is poor (`0.7781`), so probability scale is not trustworthy.
  - Calibrated HGB all-threshold bets: `853`, accuracy `0.4853`, profit `-27.3720`, ROI `-0.0321`.
  - Calibrated HGB is positive only from threshold `0.02` upward, with very small samples at higher thresholds (`17` bets at `0.06`, `2` at `0.08`).
- Total goals:
  - Raw HGB all-threshold bets: `891`, accuracy `0.5320`, profit `23.3520`, ROI `0.0262`.
  - Raw HGB weakens as threshold rises and is nearly flat by `0.10`.
  - Calibrated HGB all-threshold bets: `891`, accuracy `0.4815`, profit `-39.0830`, ROI `-0.0439`.
  - Calibrated HGB is positive only at threshold `0.04`, with just `37` bets.
- Initial read: raw HGB shows positive ROI in this single validation split, especially Asian handicap, but calibration flips full-sample ROI negative. This suggests a real direction signal may exist, but probability calibration and edge threshold selection are not stable enough yet. Next useful step is walk-forward or repeated time-split validation before using any edge threshold in recommendation logic.

Baseline walk-forward edge backtest v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-walk-forward-edge`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_walk_forward_edge_service.py`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-walk-forward-edge-v1.md`.
- Scope:
  - Asian handicap and total goals only.
  - Uses rolling chronological folds with train ratio `0.60`, validation ratio `0.10`, and `5` folds.
  - Per fold, compares raw HGB and sigmoid-calibrated HGB using `team_form_plus_all_markets` features.
  - Edge thresholds: `0.00`, `0.02`, `0.04`, `0.06`, `0.08`, `0.10`.
- Asian handicap:
  - Raw HGB threshold `0.00`: `2077` bets, positive ROI in `3/5` folds, average ROI `0.0402`, worst ROI `-0.0546`.
  - Raw HGB threshold `0.10`: `1266` bets, positive ROI in `4/5` folds, average ROI `0.0613`, worst ROI `-0.0050`.
  - Calibrated HGB threshold `0.00`: positive ROI in `1/5` folds, average ROI `-0.0260`.
  - Calibrated HGB high thresholds can show positive average ROI, but sample size collapses (`77` bets at `0.06`, `20` at `0.08`, `2` at `0.10`), so this is not reliable yet.
- Total goals:
  - Raw HGB threshold `0.00`: `2221` bets, positive ROI in `2/5` folds, average ROI `-0.0008`, worst ROI `-0.0424`.
  - Raw HGB remains roughly break-even to mildly negative across most thresholds.
  - Calibrated HGB threshold `0.00`: positive ROI in `0/5` folds, average ROI `-0.0607`.
- Initial read: this supports the concern that the single validation split was optimistic. Asian handicap raw HGB still has a possible signal, especially at stronger edge thresholds, but it is not stable enough for recommendation automation. Total goals has no clear edge yet. Next useful step is to build a recommendation sandbox/report that logs candidate picks without acting on them, or to improve probability calibration before any production recommendation threshold.

Baseline recommendation sandbox v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-recommendation-sandbox`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_recommendation_sandbox_service.py`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-recommendation-sandbox-v1.md`.
- Scope:
  - Asian handicap only.
  - Uses raw HGB `team_form_plus_all_markets` on the existing train/validation split.
  - Filters candidate picks by `edge >= 0.10`.
  - This is an observation sandbox only. It writes a markdown report and does not create recommendation records or change source samples.
- Result:
  - Validation rows: `853`; candidates: `456`; displayed detail rows: `80`.
  - Total profit: `19.8310`; ROI `0.0435`.
  - Side split:
    - `away_cover`: `245` bets, `136` wins, profit `17.8500`, ROI `0.0729`.
    - `home_cover`: `211` bets, `110` wins, profit `1.9810`, ROI `0.0094`.
  - League distribution is broad, but league ROI is highly uneven. Examples:
    - Positive: Norway 1. Division `16` bets ROI `0.4133`; La Liga `16` bets ROI `0.3649`; Sweden Superettan `17` bets ROI `0.2552`; MLS `28` bets ROI `0.1186`.
    - Negative: Serie A `16` bets ROI `-0.4973`; J1 League `18` bets ROI `-0.3497`; Belgian Jupiler Pro League `12` bets ROI `-0.3582`.
- Initial read: the sandbox keeps the Asian handicap signal alive, especially on `away_cover`, but also shows clear direction and league sensitivity. Do not automate recommendations yet. Next useful step is to add walk-forward sandbox output or threshold comparison for candidate details, so we can see whether the `away_cover` bias and league effects persist across time folds.

Baseline walk-forward recommendation sandbox v1 completed:

- CLI command: `icewine samples baseline-walk-forward-sandbox`.
- Service: `src/icewine_prediction/baseline_walk_forward_sandbox_service.py`.
- Input: `local_data/training/baseline_dynamic_features_main_leagues_20260529.csv`.
- Report: `docs/模型实验/20260529-baseline-walk-forward-sandbox-v1.md`.
- Scope:
  - Asian handicap only.
  - Uses raw HGB `team_form_plus_all_markets`.
  - Rolling chronological folds with train ratio `0.60`, validation ratio `0.10`, `5` folds.
  - Filters candidate picks by `edge >= 0.10`, showing top `20` candidates per fold.
  - Observation sandbox only; does not create recommendation records or change source samples.
- Result:
  - Total candidates: `1266`; total profit `77.3850`; ROI `0.0611`.
  - Positive ROI folds: `4/5`.
  - Fold ROI:
    - Fold 1: `256` bets, ROI `0.0203`.
    - Fold 2: `242` bets, ROI `0.1177`.
    - Fold 3: `246` bets, ROI `-0.0050`.
    - Fold 4: `265` bets, ROI `0.0451`.
    - Fold 5: `257` bets, ROI `0.1284`.
  - Side stability:
    - `away_cover`: `610` bets, positive ROI in `5/5` folds, profit `52.3050`, ROI `0.0857`.
    - `home_cover`: `656` bets, positive ROI in `2/5` folds, profit `25.0800`, ROI `0.0382`.
- Initial read: this is the strongest evidence so far that the current Asian handicap signal is concentrated on the model-favored `away_cover` side. It is still not production-ready because probabilities remain poorly calibrated and league effects are uneven, but next work should prioritize an `away_cover`-focused threshold/league stability report before building any automated recommendation action.
